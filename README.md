# Fission

Fission is a Rust-native reverse-engineering and binary decompilation workspace. It is built around a Fission-owned intermediate-representation pipeline, with Ghidra-style Sleigh semantics feeding Rust-owned NIR, HIR, structuring, rendering, automation, and quality gates.

The project goal is not only to decode instructions. The goal is to produce decompiler output that is mechanically traceable, semantically defensible, and eventually readable enough to be useful in day-to-day reverse engineering.

This README is intentionally long. It is a practical orientation document for contributors, operators, and future agents working in the repository. The shorter source-of-truth references remain in `docs/`, `AGENTS.md`, and the crate-local `AGENTS.md` files.

## Project Status

- Fission is a research-heavy Rust workspace for binary loading, instruction lifting, decompiler IR, structuring, automation, and product surfaces.
- The canonical semantic layer is `fission-pcode`, especially the NIR/HIR and structuring modules.
- Application orchestration belongs in `fission-decompiler` and user-facing command routing belongs in `fission-cli`.
- Binary parsing and provenance belong in `fission-loader`.
- Static facts and native preparation services belong in `fission-static`.
- Sleigh decode and raw p-code lift behavior belong in `fission-sleigh`.
- Quality reports and automation lanes belong in `fission-automation`.
- Vendor trees are references only. Production paths must not depend on them at runtime or build time.
- Checked-in utility resources under `utils/` must be accessed through the existing resource-root mechanisms, not hardcoded absolute paths.
- Current day-to-day quality work prioritizes x86 and x86-64 decompilation correctness and readable pseudocode.

Fission should be treated as a system with strict ownership boundaries. If a semantic issue is discovered in the final pseudocode, the fix should land where the behavior is owned, not in the renderer or README-level presentation.

## Quick Start

### Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sjkim1127/Fission.git
cd Fission
```

### Install Requirements

- Rust 1.85 or newer.
- `cargo-nextest` for the preferred local test runner.
- A modern C toolchain if local fixtures or corpus binaries need to be rebuilt.

```bash
rustup update
cargo install cargo-nextest --locked
```

### Pull Required Runtime Assets

The Rust workspace can build without every large resource, but real decompilation needs Sleigh specifications and some quality lanes need signature or support data. `utils/` is not checked into git; pull the bundled release asset instead:

```bash
mkdir -p utils
curl -L --fail --show-error \
  "https://github.com/sjkim1127/Fission/releases/download/assets-v1/fission-utils.tar.gz" \
  -o /tmp/fission-utils.tar.gz
tar -xzf /tmp/fission-utils.tar.gz -C utils --strip-components=1
```

### Build the CLI

```bash
cargo build -p fission-cli --release
./target/release/fission_cli --help
```

For local iteration, prefer `--profile quick-release` over `--release`:
`[profile.release]` uses fat LTO + `codegen-units = 1` for shipping-quality
runtime perf, which serializes codegen/linking and dominates rebuild time.
`[profile.quick-release]` (workspace `Cargo.toml`) drops those two knobs but
keeps `opt-level = 3`, so decomp-speed/output checks stay representative —
measured ~2.9x faster on a touch-one-core-crate rebuild (44s → 15s), with
byte-identical output on the real-binary regression set and ~9% slower
runtime on the heaviest measured function. Binaries land in
`target/quick-release/`. Use plain `--release` for anything going into a
benchmark run, a release build, or a perf measurement that needs to match
production codegen.

```bash
cargo build -p fission-cli --profile quick-release
./target/quick-release/fission_cli --help
```

### Run Common Checks

```bash
cargo nextest run -p fission-pcode
cargo check -p fission-pcode
cargo check -p fission-decompiler
cargo check -p fission-automation
```

## Architecture in One Page

The shortest useful architecture summary is: binary bytes are loaded by `fission-loader`, instruction semantics are lifted through `fission-sleigh`, canonical IR and decompiler semantics are owned by `fission-pcode`, orchestration is performed by `fission-decompiler`, and user or automation surfaces consume those results without inventing new semantic policy.

```
Binary bytes
  -> fission-loader
  -> fission-static facts and provenance
  -> fission-sleigh decode and p-code lift
  -> fission-pcode NIR
  -> fission-pcode HIR
  -> structuring, cleanup, rendering
  -> fission-decompiler result contracts
  -> CLI, TUI, GUI, automation, reports
```

- `fission-pcode` is the semantic owner.
- `fission-pcode::nir::structuring` is the structuring owner.
- `fission-decompiler` is the orchestration owner.
- `fission-static` is the facts and preparation owner.
- `fission-loader` is the binary-format owner.
- Printer surfaces are consume-only.
- Benchmark and report code must project canonical telemetry instead of inventing parallel counters.

## Core Pipeline

1. Load bytes from a supported binary format.
2. Classify format, architecture, sections, symbols, imports, exports, and executable regions.
3. Attach provenance and identity hints without changing IR semantics.
4. Prepare static facts needed by the decompiler.
5. Decode instructions through Sleigh language definitions.
6. Emit raw p-code in a form that can be compared against parity expectations.
7. Lower p-code into Fission NIR.
8. Normalize NIR while preserving semantics.
9. Recover type, calling convention, stack, pointer, and data-flow hints when evidence supports them.
10. Build HIR as a human-readable representation.
11. Apply structuring passes using CFG, dominance, post-dominance, SCC, and proof evidence.
12. Render pseudocode without inventing missing semantics.
13. Report telemetry through canonical counters.
14. Use automation lanes to compare quality over time.

## CLI Guide

The CLI is the fastest product surface for validating loader and decompiler behavior locally. It should expose capabilities, not own semantic fixes.

```bash
fission_cli --help
fission_cli info <binary>
fission_cli list <binary>
fission_cli decomp <binary> --addr 0x1400010a0
fission_cli decomp <binary> --all --json
```

- Use `info` for loader-level identity and provenance questions.
- Use `list` for function discovery questions.
- Use `decomp` for function-level pseudocode output.
- Use JSON output when comparing rows, caches, or automation artifacts.
- Keep command-line compatibility shims separate from semantic behavior.

## Resource Bundle

Fission keeps large or operationally specific data out of git and ships it as a standalone `utils/` resource bundle (`fission-utils.tar.gz`) attached to the `assets-v1` GitHub Release.

- `utils/sleigh-specs/` contains Sleigh language resources and manifests.
- `utils/ghidra-data/` contains reference data and provenance notes.
- `utils/MANIFEST.md` documents utility resources.
- Runtime code should use `PathConfig`, `PATHS`, `resource_roots`, or existing loaders.
- Production code must not hardcode `/Users/sjkim1127/Fission/utils`.
- CI fetches the bundle via `.github/actions/setup-utils` (cached by `assets_tag`); `.github/workflows/publish-utils-assets.yml` regenerates it from a given ref.

```bash
mkdir -p utils
curl -L --fail --show-error \
  "https://github.com/sjkim1127/Fission/releases/download/assets-v1/fission-utils.tar.gz" \
  -o /tmp/fission-utils.tar.gz
tar -xzf /tmp/fission-utils.tar.gz -C utils --strip-components=1
fission_cli resources status
```

## Decompiler Quality Loop

Quality work starts from a concrete function or row, not a vague aggregate. The loop below is the standard operating model for decompiler-quality changes.

1. Anchor the exact row, binary, address, function name, behavior status, and quality scores.
2. Record stdout, stderr, line count, byte count, and static feature gaps.
3. Find the canonical owner: Sleigh, NIR, type recovery, structuring, cleanup, printer, benchmark, or automation.
4. Add focused coverage for the invariant.
5. Make the smallest invariant-based production change.
6. Run the targeted test first.
7. Run relevant crate-level tests and checks.
8. Run the focused source-semantic row with stale caches disabled when available.
9. Inspect artifacts, not only aggregate numbers.
10. Run broader smoke or automation checks after a focused improvement.
11. Report whether behavior mechanically changed and whether quality improved.

### Quality Evidence Rules

- A passing synthetic test is necessary but not sufficient for a decompiler-quality claim.
- A changed pseudocode file is not automatically a quality improvement.
- Aggregate metrics must not hide row-level regressions.
- Raw p-code parity must be checked before NIR or HIR interpretation when the lift is suspect.
- Ghidra may be used as a cleanroom reference for behavior, not as a copied implementation source.

## NIR and HIR Policy

NIR and HIR have different contracts.

| Layer | Contract | Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| NIR | Semantically identical to the source behavior. | Correctness and parity are the highest priorities. |
| HIR | Human-readable pseudocode derived from correct semantics. | Readability can be prioritized when the underlying semantics remain traceable. |

- NIR must not be prettified by losing behavior.
- HIR may remove unnecessary temporaries when that improves readability without hiding semantics.
- Printer code must not fake structure that the structuring owner did not prove.
- Type and data abstraction should be recovered at semantic layers, not by output-only substitution.

## Sleigh Runtime

The Sleigh runtime is the decode and raw p-code lift path. It should execute `.sla` ConstructTpl semantics rather than accumulating manual opcode mappings.

- Keep `.sla` execution as the success source.
- Raw p-code canaries are admission gates for lift changes.
- Validate x86 and x86-64 shared-token cases carefully.
- Preserve Ghidra-style materialization behavior where downstream parity depends on it.
- Do not grow legacy token cursor or compatibility-classifier debt without a clear retirement path.

## Loader Policy

The loader owns binary format parsing and metadata provenance. It does not own decompiler repair.

1. `detect` stage in the loader pipeline.
2. `probe/load-spec` stage in the loader pipeline.
3. `map` stage in the loader pipeline.
4. `symbols` stage in the loader pipeline.
5. `finalize` stage in the loader pipeline.

- Known unsupported formats should fail closed with typed messages.
- Raw binary loading must not silently become a fallback for unknown bytes.
- Container formats must be classified before executable loading.
- Loader provenance is a public contract consumed by CLI and GUI surfaces.
- Function lists must use loader-owned views rather than surface-specific filtering rules.

## Static Facts

Static facts help the decompiler, but they are not the final semantic owner. The fact layer should provide evidence, provenance, and analysis services.

- Xrefs and discovery facts.
- Patch and string facts.
- Native decompiler preparation.
- FactStore-style aggregation for decompilation contexts.
- Binary-derived helper services.

## Dynamic Analysis and Emulator

Fission includes a pure-Rust dynamic analysis engine (`fission-emulator`) capable of executing arbitrary x86/x86-64 P-Code sequences produced by Sleigh, without requiring any external runtime like QEMU or Unicorn.

The emulator is a core pillar for future dynamic reasoning capabilities:
- **Tracing and Differential Analysis** — Execute binaries with a full instruction trace and diff the output against expected behavior.
- **Time-Travel Debugging (TTD)** — Record/replay execution with memory and register delta snapshots.
- **Concolic Execution** — Use TTD snapshots to fork execution at unexplored conditional branches.
- **Symbolic Taint Tracking** — Propagate symbolic expressions through P-Code operations and track tainted data flows from inputs (e.g. `stdin`) through memory and registers.

### Architecture

```

  ├── core.rs          — Emulator state, main run loop, register I/O, TTD hooks
  ├── pcode/

  │   └── state.rs     — MachineState: address spaces + shadow memory
  ├── arch/            — Architecture descriptors, calling conventions

  │   ├── linux/       — Linux syscall HLE (read, write, mmap, brk, exit, ...)
  │   ├── windows/     — Windows HLE stubs
  │   └── bare_metal/  — No-OS / embedded HLE
  ├── sym/

  └── loader.rs        — Binary loading bridge for the emulator
```

### CLI Integration

```bash
# Emulate a binary (default: auto-detect OS, no limits)
fission_cli run <binary>

# Limit to N instructions
fission_cli run <binary> --max-inst 10000

# Provide stdin mock data
fission_cli run <binary> --stdin "hello
"

# Emit full instruction trace (JSON)
fission_cli run <binary> --trace --json

# Enable TTD recording (snapshot every 1000 instructions)
fission_cli run <binary> --ttd-record 1000

# Seek TTD to step N (rewind and replay from that point)
fission_cli run <binary> --ttd-record 1000 --ttd-seek 5000

# Enable concolic path exploration
fission_cli run <binary> --ttd-record 500 --sym-explore
```

### Operating System HLE

The emulator uses High-Level Emulation (HLE) rather than emulating an actual OS kernel. Each architecture+OS pair has its own HLE handler:

| OS | HLE Handler | Key syscalls |
|---|---|---|
| Linux x86-64 | `os/linux/mod.rs` | `read`, `write`, `mmap`, `brk`, `exit_group`, `open`, `close`, `fstat`, `stat` |
| Windows x86-64 | `os/windows/hle.rs` | `VirtualAlloc`, `HeapAlloc`, `WriteFile`, `ExitProcess`, and common NT stubs |
| Bare Metal | `os/bare_metal/mod.rs` | Minimal: `semihosting` stubs only |

HLE handlers can intercept function calls by name (via PLT/IAT hooks) or by recognized calling patterns.

### Calling Convention Support

The `arch/` subsystem provides architecture-agnostic calling convention helpers:

- `Emulator::read_arg(n)` — read the nth integer argument per the current ABI
- `Emulator::write_return_val(v)` — write to the return register
- `Emulator::simulate_return()` — pop the stack or read the link register and set PC

Currently supported: **System V AMD64 ABI** (Linux x86-64), **Microsoft x64** (Windows), and a stub for **ARM AArch64**.

---

## Time-Travel Debugging (TTD)

The `fission-ttd` crate provides a deterministic execution recorder and replayer. It is the backbone for all forms of non-linear execution analysis.

### How TTD Works

1. **Recording Phase** — As the `Emulator` executes, every N instructions (configurable via `--ttd-record <N>`) it captures:
   - Complete CPU register state (`RegisterState`)
   - Memory write deltas: `(address, old_bytes, new_bytes)`
   - Shadow state (taint) deltas: `(space_id, address, old_node_id, new_node_id)`

2. **Snapshot Storage** — Snapshots are stored in a bounded ring buffer (`TTDRecorder`) with configurable capacity. Older snapshots are evicted when capacity is reached.

3. **Seeking / Rewinding** — `Emulator::ttd_seek(step)` locates the most recent snapshot at or before `step`, then restores:
   - All GP registers from `RegisterState`
   - All memory bytes from `MemoryDelta` records
   - All symbolic taint mappings from `ShadowDelta` records

4. **Replay** — After rewinding, `emulator.run()` continues forward from the restored state.

### TTD Data Structures

| Type | Crate | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `TTDRecorder` | `fission-ttd` | Manages the ring buffer of `ExecutionSnapshot`s |
| `ExecutionSnapshot` | `fission-ttd` | Single-point snapshot: registers + memory + shadow deltas |
| `MemoryDelta` | `fission-ttd` | Before/after memory diff for one address range |
| `ShadowDelta` | `fission-ttd` | Before/after taint AST node diff for one byte position |
| `RegisterState` | `fission-ttd` | Full x86-64 GP register snapshot |

## Symbolic Execution and Taint Engine

Fission's taint and symbolic engine is a pure-Rust implementation — no Z3 bindings, no C++ FFI, no external SMT dependencies. It is designed for long-term maintainability and architecture-agnostic reasoning.

### `SymExpr` AST Nodes

Every symbolic value is represented as a node in the `SymExpr` tree:

| Variant | Description |
|---|---|
| `Const { val, size }` | Concrete bitvector constant |
| `Var { id, name, size }` | Named symbolic variable (e.g. `stdin_0x4000`) |
| `Add(a, b)` / `Sub(a, b)` / `Mul(a, b)` | Integer arithmetic |
| `And(a, b)` / `Or(a, b)` / `Xor(a, b)` | Bitwise operations |
| `Shl(a, b)` / `Lshr(a, b)` | Shift operations |
| `Eq(a, b)` / `Neq(a, b)` / `Ult(a, b)` / `Ule(a, b)` | Comparisons (return 1-bit) |
| `Ite { cond, t, f }` | If-then-else |
| `Extract { expr, lsb, size }` | Bit extraction |
| `Concat(a, b)` | Bitvector concatenation |

### Shadow Memory (Taint State)

The `MachineState` holds a parallel "shadow" layer alongside the concrete memory:

```rust
// shadow_memory: (space_id, byte_address) -> SymNodeId
pub shadow_memory: HashMap<(u64, u64), u32>
```

- `space_id = 2` → CPU registers (Sleigh register address space)
- `space_id = 3` → RAM (Sleigh ram address space)

When a concrete byte is written, its shadow entry is cleared. When a symbolic value is written, its shadow entry is updated with the corresponding AST node ID.

### Taint Propagation Table

| P-Code Op | Taint Behavior |
|---|---|
| `COPY` | Propagate source shadow to destination |
| `LOAD` | Propagate shadow from RAM byte to output varnode |
| `STORE` | Propagate shadow from source varnode to RAM byte |
| `INT_ADD` | If either input is tainted, build `SymExpr::Add(a, b)` and store new node |
| `INT_SUB` | Similar: build `SymExpr::Sub` |
| Other ops | Currently concrete-only (no taint propagation yet) |

### Taint Sources

The primary taint source is `stdin`. In `os/linux/mod.rs`, the `sys_read(fd=0, ...)` handler:
1. Reads bytes from `stdin_buffer` (the `--stdin` mock).
2. Writes them into RAM as concrete bytes.
3. For each byte, calls `solver.register_var("stdin_<addr>", 1)` to create a `SymExpr::Var`.
4. Tags the corresponding `shadow_memory` entries with the new node ID.

From that point forward, any P-Code operation that reads those bytes will propagate the taint forward into new `SymExpr` constraint trees.

## Concolic Path Exploration

Concolic (concrete + symbolic) execution combines real execution with symbolic state to explore multiple code paths automatically.

### How It Works

1. The emulator runs normally in **concrete mode**, recording TTD snapshots along the way.
2. Every `CBranch` (conditional branch) P-Code instruction emits a `SymBranch` event containing:
   - The TTD step index at the branch point
   - The current PC value
   - Whether the branch was taken or not
   - The alternate target (address or relative P-Code index)
3. After the current path terminates, the `SymbolicExecutor` pops unexplored branches from a queue.
4. It rewinds the emulator to the snapshot closest to the branch step via `ttd_seek()`.
5. It forces the PC (or P-Code index) to the **alternate** target and resumes execution.
6. This continues until the exploration queue is empty.

```
Path 1:  [A] → [B] → [D] → halt        (branch at B taken = true)
Rewind to B
Path 2:  [A] → [B] → [C] → [E] → halt  (branch at B taken = false)
```

### `SymbolicExecutor`

The `SymbolicExecutor` (`sym/mod.rs`) is the exploration driver:

```rust
pub struct SymbolicExecutor {
    pub emu: Emulator,
    pub queue: Vec<SymBranch>,  // unexplored branch events
}
```

It calls `emu.run()` in a loop, drains `emu.sym_events` into the queue, and rewinds to the next unexplored branch. Each new execution path may reveal additional branches, which are added to the queue.

### Future: Full Symbolic Mode

The current implementation is **concolic scaffolding**: it explores paths by forcing PC values, but does not yet invert branch conditions symbolically via the `Solver`. The planned evolution:

1. When a `CBranch` is encountered and a taint variable is used in the branch condition, add the negated constraint `!condition` to `solver.assertions`.
2. Call `solver.check_sat()` to verify the alternate path is feasible.
3. Use `solver.get_value(var_id)` to obtain a concrete input that triggers the alternate path.
4. Replay with that concrete input instead of forcing PC.

This requires implementing the DPLL/CDCL bit-blasting core inside `fission-solver`, which is the next development milestone.

## Structuring Model

The active structuring path is graph-oriented and proof-driven. It should use deterministic collapse rules and explicit fallback when legality is incomplete.

- `StructureGraph` owns the collapsed overlay.
- `CollapseDriver` applies deterministic collapse rules.
- `RegionProof` records replacement and readiness evidence.
- Collapse only proof-complete and emit-ready regions.
- Fallback output should be explicit rather than disguised as clean structure.
- Printer and postprocess code must not reconstruct structure after the fact.

### Pass Pipeline Rules

There are two independent pass-orchestration tracks; neither subsumes the
other, because they operate on different IR shapes. Current migration
status and the full per-stage backlog live in `PROJECT.md`.

- **Structuring (pre-structuring, block-CFG level):** new transformations
  should be expressed as `NirPass` implementations
  (`crates/fission-pcode/src/midend/pass/`), operating on `NirFunc` (wraps
  `PreviewBuilder`'s block/CFG state) through `PassCtx` instead of capturing
  builder internals. Every pass declares an `InvariantBasis` (dominator
  tree, postdominator tree, SCC, loop body, edge classification) so review
  can reject address/function-specific overfitting. `PassOutcome::changed`
  must be accurate. Binary-specific and address-specific guards are
  forbidden in pass bodies.
- **Normalize (post-structuring, `HirFunction`/`Vec<HirStmt>` level):** new
  transformations should be expressed as `action_pipeline::Pass`
  implementations (`fission-midend-core::action_pipeline`), registered as
  `ActionGroup` entries in `fission-midend-normalize/src/pipeline/groups.rs`.
  Prefer the existing composable primitives (`fn_pass`, `cleanup_pass`,
  `gated_followup`, `admission_gated`) over new free-function control flow
  in `pipeline/stages.rs`; this migration is in progress, is done
  stage-by-stage with a real-binary before/after parity check per slice, and
  is not something to attempt in one large change. `cleanup_pass` is
  budget-gated (mirrors the legacy `run_cleanup_block` admission check on
  `EARLY_CLEANUP_BLOCK_STMT_LIMIT`/`BLOCK_LIMIT`); `fn_pass` is not — using
  the wrong one silently changes admission behavior on large functions
  without failing any test on small ones, so always check which one the
  original call site used before registering.
- A chain whose body calls something that itself needs `diag`/`perf`
  (`apply_type_signature_fixed_point`, `run_cleanup_family_passes`) cannot
  go through `fn_pass`/`GatedFollowupPass` — neither primitive carries
  `diag`/`perf` through to a callee. Keep those as a named `stage_pass` step
  instead of dropping the forwarding silently.

### Determinism

Decompiler output must be identical across separate process runs of the
same binary (`AGENTS.md` Core Rule 4). `std::collections::HashMap`/`HashSet`
use a per-process-random `RandomState` by default; any unsorted iteration
over one that feeds a `.first()`/`.find_map()`-style pick (not just a
`.contains()`/`.get()` membership check) is a real nondeterminism bug, not
a style nit — two were found and fixed this way in
`fission-pcode::midend::structuring`. When adding a new `HashMap`/`HashSet`
in `fission-pcode::midend` or `fission-midend-structuring`, prefer the
crate-local fixed-seed alias (`rustc_hash::FxBuildHasher`, already the
default there) over `std::collections::HashMap` directly, and never iterate
either collection to pick a specific value without sorting first.

## Telemetry and Reports

Telemetry is useful only if the same counter means the same thing everywhere. Fission keeps canonical decompiler counters in `NirBuildStats` and projects them outward.

- `NirBuildStats` is the canonical telemetry owner.
- Automation reports should consume canonical counters.
- Benchmark layers should not define parallel meanings for the same behavior.
- Regression reasons should map to structuring, materialization, type, or lift families.
- Reporting changes are not semantic fixes unless the row-level oracle moves.

## Testing Matrix

| Scope | Default command | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| pcode tests | `cargo nextest run -p fission-pcode` | NIR, HIR, structuring, printer, and type-hint work. |
| pcode check | `cargo check -p fission-pcode` | Compile validation after semantic changes. |
| decompiler check | `cargo check -p fission-decompiler` | Orchestration or Rust-Sleigh glue changes. |
| automation check | `cargo check -p fission-automation` | Telemetry or reporting changes. |
| core tests | `cargo nextest run -p fission-core` | Resource path and shared core changes. |
| CLI build | `cargo build -p fission-cli --release` | Product and benchmark validation requiring the release CLI. |
| workspace check | `cargo check --workspace` | Broad compile confidence before larger handoff. |

- Use `cargo nextest run` by default for Rust tests.
- Use `cargo test` for doctests or harness-specific behavior.
- Run targeted tests before crate-wide tests.
- Do not claim success from a targeted test if crate-level regression remains.
- Call out known unrelated failures explicitly.

## CI and Release

CI source of truth lives in `.github/workflows/`. Reusable workflows keep the main pipelines smaller and make heavy checks explicit.

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- `.github/workflows/ci-heavy.yml`
- `.github/workflows/cd.yml`
- `.github/workflows/release-tag.yml`
- `.github/workflows/fuzz.yml`
- `.github/workflows/ci-cd-monitor.yml`
- `.github/workflows/reusable-build-cli.yml`
- `.github/workflows/reusable-cli-smoke.yml`
- `.github/workflows/reusable-corpus-validation.yml`
- `.github/workflows/reusable-coverage.yml`
- `.github/workflows/reusable-lint-format.yml`
- `.github/workflows/reusable-miri.yml`
- `.github/workflows/reusable-msrv.yml`
- `.github/workflows/reusable-nir-check.yml`
- `.github/workflows/reusable-nir-regression-gate.yml`
- `.github/workflows/reusable-run-tests.yml`
- `.github/workflows/reusable-security-check.yml`
- `.github/workflows/reusable-setup-rust.yml`
- `.github/workflows/reusable-upload-artifacts.yml`
- `.github/workflows/reusable-benchmark.yml`

Release tags should be shipped through `Release Tag (CI green)`, which tags only a commit whose push run has already passed the required CI path.

## Development Workflow

1. Read the nearest `AGENTS.md` before editing a scoped area.
2. Confirm the owner layer before changing behavior.
3. Inspect existing tests and local patterns.
4. Add focused coverage for new invariants.
5. Make scoped production changes.
6. Run targeted validation.
7. Run crate-level validation.
8. Inspect Git status and stage only intended hunks.
9. Report both mechanical change and quality impact.

### Dirty Worktree Discipline

- Assume unrelated changes belong to the user.
- Do not revert changes you did not make.
- Ignore unrelated dirty files unless they block the task.
- If a touched file has user changes, read carefully and work with them.
- Use non-interactive Git commands when possible.

## Security and Malware Sample Policy

Reverse-engineering repositories often touch untrusted binaries. Treat samples and externally sourced executables as hostile inputs.

- Do not execute unknown samples as part of normal decompiler validation.
- Prefer parsing and static analysis paths.
- Keep malware sample handling aligned with `docs/MALWARE_SAMPLE_POLICY.md` and `SECURITY.md`.
- Do not upload private or suspicious binaries to third-party services without explicit approval.
- Keep sample provenance visible in reports.

## Contributor Notes

- Prefer small invariant-based fixes over address-specific special cases.
- Use CFG, dominance, post-dominance, SCC, dataflow, and fixed-point reasoning where appropriate.
- Do not add runtime dependencies on `vendor/`.
- Do not add C++ bindings to shortcut reference behavior.
- Do not bypass existing resource configuration helpers.
- Document new public contracts near the code and in `docs/` when they affect users.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | First check |
|---|---|
| Missing Sleigh specs | Pull `fission-utils.tar.gz` from the `assets-v1` release (see [Resource Bundle](#resource-bundle)) and check resource status. |
| CLI cannot find resources | Check `FISSION_RESOURCE_ROOT`, `--resource-root`, and `PathConfig::detect` behavior. |
| Raw p-code mismatch | Start in `fission-sleigh` before interpreting NIR output. |
| NIR is wrong but p-code is right | Investigate NIR materialization, normalization, or type hint application. |
| HIR is unreadable but NIR is right | Investigate structuring, cleanup, or printer consume behavior. |
| Report counters disagree | Trace the counter back to `NirBuildStats`. |
| Loader identifies unsupported container | Extract an executable child explicitly instead of raw-loading the container. |
| A test passes locally but CI fails | Check LFS pulls, OS-specific paths, feature flags, and reusable workflow inputs. |

## Roadmap

- Improve x86 and x86-64 pseudocode quality on small sample binaries first.
- Continue strengthening control-flow recovery for if, else, switch, loop, break, and continue structures.
- Improve pointer, array, struct, and field-access expression recovery.
- Improve calling convention, parameter, local-variable, return-value, accumulator, and induction-variable cleanup.
- Maintain raw p-code parity gates for Sleigh changes.
- Improve FID and name recovery relative to signature ecosystems.
- Expand architecture and file-format breadth after x86/x86-64 quality is strong enough.
- Expand the pure-Rust symbolic execution engine: implement DPLL/CDCL bit-blasting in `fission-solver`.
- Add more P-Code taint propagation opcodes in `fission-emulator`.
- Connect taint-tracking results to decompiler type recovery.
- Continue the normalize `action_pipeline`/`ActionGroup` migration stage by stage (see `PROJECT.md` for current status and backlog); each stage's imperative `run_stage_*` free function is replaced with declarative passes, validated with a real-binary before/after check.

## Review Question Bank

Use these questions during code review or before handing off a quality cycle.

- [ ] 01. Which layer owns this behavior?

- [ ] 03. What exact row, address, sample, command, or artifact motivated the change?
- [ ] 04. What invariant does the new test encode?
- [ ] 05. Could this patch accidentally special-case one binary?
